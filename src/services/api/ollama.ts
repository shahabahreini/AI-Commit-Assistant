Follow these steps carefully:

0. Understand the meaning of each commit type:
   - feat: Adding a new feature or enhancement
   - fix: Fixing a bug or issue
   - docs: Making documentation-only changes (e.g., README, JSDoc)
   - style: Formatting or style changes that do not affect code logic (e.g., lint fixes, cosmetic adjustments)
   - refactor: Code changes that do not fix bugs or add features but improve structure or clarity
   - test: Adding or updating tests
   - chore: Maintenance tasks or minor updates that donâ€™t change app logic (e.g., updating dependencies, build scripts)
   
1. Look at the provided diff, which is stored in the variable diff content.
   - Identify the nature of the changes: 
       * Are they adding a new feature (feat)?
       * Fixing a bug (fix)?
       * Updating documentation (docs)?
       * Changing formatting or style (style)?
       * Refactoring code without changing functionality (refactor)?
       * Adding or modifying tests (test)?
       * Performing chores or maintenance (chore)?

2. Write the first line of the commit message:
   - It must start with exactly one of these words: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - It must use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" rather than "Adds" or "Added")
   - It must be under 72 characters (rephrase it if the generated if needed to fit under 72 characters)
   - It must be short, direct, and technical

3. Leave exactly one blank line after the first line.

4. Write a concise description in bullet points that explains:
   - **What** was changed and **where** it was changed (e.g., which file or function)
   - **Why** it matters or its **impact** (if this is relevant)
   - Avoid buzzwords, marketing jargon, or fluff. Be direct and technical.

5. Output your result **exactly** in this format (no extra text or explanation before or after):

<type>: <short description>

<point 1>
<point 2 and more if needed>

**Here is the diff** Here is the file changes (diff) content in the following lines:
${diff}`;
